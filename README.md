## How to Use

To use PokeGen:

1.  **Open the Application:** Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. This will load the application.

2.  **Generate a Team:** Click the "Roll" button to generate a completely new team of six random Pokémon. Each Pokémon will be displayed as a card with its name, sprite, types, Pokédex number, and stats.

3.  **Reroll Individual Pokémon:** If you're not happy with a particular Pokémon on your team, you can click on its card to reroll it. This will replace that specific Pokémon with another random one, while keeping the rest of your team intact.

4.  **Filter by Generation:** Use the generation selector (e.g., a dropdown menu or checkboxes) to restrict the Pokémon that can be generated to specific generations. For example, selecting "Generation 1" will only generate Pokémon from the original 151.
